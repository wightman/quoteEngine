Origin
------

In the fall of 2012 the Faculty of Computer Science at the University of New Brunswick began an ad-hoc series of extra-curricular workshops held during term for students interested in topics and technologies outside of what they could take in courses. The Web Wizards Workshop was formed to give first-year students exposure to open source web technologies that they either (i) wouldn't see in their first year or (ii) paralleled what they were seeing in their first-year.

The quoteEngine is the result of the Winter Term 2013 workshop and involves:
* http authentication
* basic html and some css
